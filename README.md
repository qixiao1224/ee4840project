# ee4840project - CNN accelerator based on FPGA
This project is developed in EE4840 Embedded Systems in Columbia.
The hardware code and software code are working fine respectively but the integration does not meet our need.
## NPU Part
Verilog and SystemVerilog is used here. Thanks for the devleopment and optimization of NPU (Neuron Processing Unit) part by Tianchen Yu. 
The main part of the NPU consists of MAC module, maxpooling module, converter module(16bit to 8bit) and so on. 
## Memory Part
The RAM part is developed by Qixiao Zhang, Haichun Zhao and Haomiao Li. 
## Software Part
Software Part and the HW-SW interface is developed by Yue Niu.
